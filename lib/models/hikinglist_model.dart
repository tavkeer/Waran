          'Sindh and Lidder valleys are two most beautiful side valleys of Kashmir and got their names from the rivers flowing through these valleys( Sindh & Lidder river) Sindh valley is long, narrow opening up in North Western side of the Vale of Kashmir while the Lidder valley opens into the North Eastern corner of the valley. These valleys are separated by a long mountain range that runs from East to West forming the southern side of Sindh valley. The end of this range forms the line of mountains behind the Shalimar garden, throwing spurs from other branches form successively the half circles that enclose Dal lake, Khonmoh & valley of Tral. Sanamūs pass is one of the passes that connects these two valleys. The route is also popular for exploring Tarsar and Marsar lakes.',
