These valleys are separated by a long mountain range that runs from East to West forming the southern side of Sindh valley. The end of this range forms the line of mountains behind the Shalimar garden, throwing spurs from other branches form successively the half circles that enclose Dal lake, Khonmoh & valley of Tral.
